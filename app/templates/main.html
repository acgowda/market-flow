  <p>
    Welcome to Marketflow! This is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model that can be used for trading, developed by UCLA students in PIC16B. Visit the "Test Our Product" page to try out our product!
  </p>
  <p>
    Our model has been trained on a specified universe of securities to make predictions. Users can specify a target security and the model outputs whether the price is going "Up" or "Down".
  </p>
  <p>
    We also provide our model's performance on the most recent 2 years of data. This performance is shown on an interactive plot that displays the model's historical trading performance. In addition, we will have another plot that displays the net profit of using this model to make trades and the comparison to the actual returns over the last two years.
  </p>
  <p>
    The user also has the option of adding technical indicators to the feature-space as they see fit. The interactive plot allows the user to visualize different technical indicators that can be chosen from a pre-specified list. These include common indicators such as moving averages and various indices/commodities.
